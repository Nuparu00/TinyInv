TinyInv is a Minecraft mod, that allows you to manipulate the available inventory and hotbar slots on per-player bases. This includes:
* decreasing the number of inventory slots
* decreasing the number of hotbar slots
* increasing the number of hotbar slots
* disabling the offhand slot
* disabling the individual armor slots
* disabling the individual crafting input slots

This can be done both globally for all players - inside the config file, or individually for one player using attribute modifiers.
The mod also has a built-in way of adding attribute modifiers to existing items and status effects using datapacks.
