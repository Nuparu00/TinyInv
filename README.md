> [!WARNING]  
> This branch is here only due to a request. Aside from the fact that the 1.12.2 version itself is very limited compared to the later versions, there are no guarantees that the code in here is in fact the 1.3 version of the mod! This is just the most up-to-date 1.12.2 source, that survived the several drive wipes since the release of the 1.12.2 versions. Feel free to decompile the 1.3 .jar file to verify, whether the code matches.

TinyInv is a Minecraft mod, that allows you to manipulate the available inventory and hotbar slots on a per-player basis. This includes:
* decreasing the number of inventory slots
* decreasing the number of hotbar slots
* increasing the number of hotbar slots
* disabling the offhand slot
* disabling the individual armor slots
* disabling the individual crafting input slots

This can be done both globally for all players - inside the config file, or individually for one player using attribute modifiers.
The mod also has a built-in way of adding attribute modifiers to existing items and status effects using datapacks.
